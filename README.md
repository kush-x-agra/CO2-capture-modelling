# CO2-capture-modelling
Modelling of CO2 Capture by Reactive Absorption and Stripping Using Aspen Plus.
Modeled a CO2 Capture Plant by Reactive Absorption and Stripping using Monoethanolamine (MAE) as Solvent. Used the Rate-Based approach in RadFrac model for the reactive absorption-stripping of CO2 with MEA. Validated the model for absorber and stripper from Experimental Pilot-Plant facility. Achieved 99.12% CO2 Removal and compared simulation results with the Experimental Data.
